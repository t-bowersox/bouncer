# bouncer

A tool for checking user authorization.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @t-bowersox/bouncer
```

## Usage

Bouncer performs two primary sets of tasks:

- Issuing, revoking, & validating signed access tokens.
- Validating a user's attributes against a permissions ruleset.

### Requirements

In order to create a `Bouncer` instance, you must have the following:

- A private key string in PEM format.
- If your private key is encrypted by a passphrase, you must provide it as well.
- A public key string in PEM format.
- An object that implements the `TokenStore` interface.

#### Token signing

The private and public keys are necessary for signing and verifying access tokens. Under the hood, Bouncer uses the Node.js [`crypto.createPrivateKey`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/crypto.html#cryptocreateprivatekeykey) and [`crypto.createPublicKey`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/crypto.html#cryptocreatepublickeykey) methods to create a `KeyObject` for each.

Those `KeyObject`s are used with instances of Node's [`Sign`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/crypto.html#class-sign) and [`Verify`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/crypto.html#class-verify) classes when signing and verifying access tokens, respectively. The algorithm used for signatures is SHA256.

The `Token` interface stores only a unique session ID, the user's ID, and an expiration timestamp. The session ID is generated using Node's [`crypto.randomUUID`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/crypto.html#cryptorandomuuidoptions), which uses a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator.

#### Token stores

The `TokenStore` interface requires an object to have two methods that are used for tracking revoked tokens:

- `addToDenyList` - This is called by Bouncer to add a session ID to the "Deny List", which is a list of revoked tokens.
- `isOnDenyList` - This is called by Bouncer during token validation to see if a session ID has been revoked.

It is up to you to handle where to store the data, whether it's a key-value store, relational database, etc.

If you want to keep a dataset or log of all tokens issued by Bouncer, you will need to handle that yourself since it's outside the scope of what Bouncer's purpose.

### Authorization flow

#### Creating a `Bouncer` instance

```typescript
import { Bouncer } from "@t-bowersox/bouncer";

// This TokenStore implementation is just for demonstration
const tokenStore = {
  addToDenyList(sessionId: string, timestamp: number): boolean => {
    const database = new SomeDatabaseClass();
    return database.insert(sessionId, timestamp);
  };

  isOnDenyList(sessionId: string): boolean => {
    const database = new SomeDatabaseClass();
    return database.get(sessionId);
  };
}

// You'll most likely want to use env variables for the keys & passphrase
const bouncer = new Bouncer(
  tokenStore,
  "my-private-key-pem",
  "my-public-key-pem",
  "my-private-key-passphrase"
);
```

#### Creating an access token

An access token is a dot-separated string that includes:

- The base64 encoded token.
- The base64 encoded signature for that token.

For example: `<base64-encoded-token>.<base64-encoded-signature>`. Being base64 encoded, it's suitable for returning to the user in a secure, HTTP-only cookie.

To create a token, pass the user's ID and an expiration date (as a `Date` object) to the `createToken` method.

```typescript
const token = bouncer.createToken(1, new Date("2022-02-28 00:00:00"));
```

#### Revoking an access token

In cases where you need to invalidate a session ID, you can call the `revokeToken` method. This will add the session ID to Bouncer's Deny List, which is a store of all revoked tokens. Bouncer checks this list during the token validation process.

To add a token to the Deny List, pass it to `revokeToken`. It will return `true` if it was successful, `false` if not.

```typescript
const revoked = bouncer.revokeToken(
  "<base64-encoded-token>.<base64-encoded-signature>"
);
```

#### Validating a token

To validate a token, simply pass it to the `validateToken` method. Bouncer will return a boolean response based on the following criteria:

1. Is the token's signature verified? If so, then check:
2. Has the token expired? If not, then check:
3. Is the token on the Deny List? If not, return `true`.

Otherwise, Bouncer returns `false` indicating the token is invalid. That's a signal to your app to deny access to that user.

```typescript
const validated = bouncer.validateToken(
  "<base64-encoded-token>.<base64-encoded-signature>"
);
```

#### Validating a user

Bouncer's `validateUser` method allows you to compare a user's attributes to a `RuleSet` of validator functions. Each of the functions you add to a `RuleSet` take a value and, based on your criteria, returns a boolean: `true` if validated, `false` if not.

Each `RuleSet` keeps two internal sets of functions: one for synchronous functions and the other for async functions. All functions in the sets must return true in order for Bouncer's `validateUser` method to return `true`. If just one returns `false`, then so will `validateUser`.

```typescript
type ValidationRule<T = any> = (userData: T) => boolean;
type AsyncValidationRule<T = any> = (userData: T) => Promise<boolean>;
```

To avoid unnecessary async calls, Bouncer will first evaluate the synchronous validators if present. Only if all of those return `true` will it proceed to the async validators.

You can create as many instances of the `RuleSet` class as you need for your application. For example, you could have `RuleSet`s for different user types, different application routes, etc.

```typescript
import { Bouncer, RuleSet } from "@t-bowersox/bouncer";
import { User } from "your-app-code";

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  role: "regular",
  permissions: { read: true, write: false },
};

const syncRuleExample = (user: User): boolean =>
  user["permissions"]["read"] === true;

const asyncRuleExample = async (user: User): Promise<boolean> => {
  const database = new MyDatabaseClass();
  const result = await database.getSomeUserData(user.id);
  return !!result;
};

const ruleSet = new RuleSet([syncRuleExample], [asyncRuleExample]);

// Or...

const ruleSet = new RuleSet()
  .addSyncRule(syncRuleExample)
  .addAsyncRule(asyncRuleExample);

// Then...
const bouncer = new Bouncer(/*...*/);
const validUser = await bouncer.validateUser(user, ruleSet);
```

## API

Returns:

- `true` if the token was successfully added to the Deny List, `false` if not.

#### Method `validateToken`

Evaluates it a token is valid based on its signature, expiration date, and Deny List status.

```typescript
validateToken(unparsedToken: Base64String): boolean;
```

Parameters:

```typescript
interface TokenStore {
  addToDenyList(sessionId: string, timestamp: number): boolean;
  isOnDenyList(sessionId: string): boolean;
}
```

#### Method `addToDenyList`

```

Parameters:

- `sessionId` - a string containing the revoked token's session ID.
- `timestamp` - a number containing the current timestamp provided by `Date.now()`.

Returns:

- `true` if the token was successfully saved, `false` if not.

#### Method `isOnDenyList`

Looks for the session ID of a token in a database.

```typescript
isOnDenyList(sessionId: string): boolean;

## Contributing

This is primarily a package that I intend to reuse in my own projects. I've decided to open source it in case there are other folks who might also find it useful.

With that in mind, I only expect to make changes to Container that jibe with how I intend to use it myself.

But if you do have ideas or found bugs, please do file an issue and I'll gladly review it. 🙂
